Exercises:

Separate the functionality of wrapHtml into two functions:

One that wraps content in html tag
one that wraps content in a body tag
Name the new functions html_ and body_.

Change myhtml to use these two functions.

Add another two similar functions for the tags <head> and <title> and name them head_ and title_.

Create a new function, makeHtml, which takes two strings as input:

One string for the title
One string for the body content
And construct an HTML string using the functions implemented in the previous exercises.
