Exercises:

Add types for all of the functions we created until now

Change the implementation of the HTML functions we built to use el instead

Add a couple more functions for defining paragraphs and headings:

p_ which uses the tag <p> for paragraphs
h1_ which uses the tag <h1> for headings
Replace our Hello, world! string with richer content, use h1_ and p_. We can append HTML strings created by h1_ and p_ using the append operator <>.

Bonus: rewrite a couple of functions using lambda functions, just for fun!
